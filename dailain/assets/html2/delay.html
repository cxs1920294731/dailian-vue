        Bluetooth is not an instant transmission protocol and there are some lag / delay due to the time it takes for the signals to be encoded and transmitted. Typically if you're listening to music or audio only, you won't ever notice this lag.
    </p>
    <p class="pad-p">
        However, pair audio with video or use Bluetooth devices with musical instruments where the user expects instant feedback and it is noticeable.
    </p>
    <p class="pad-p">
    	In general, the lag should be between 0.2 to 0.5 seconds. But there are some factors that can increase the amount of lag / delay you experienced</p>
    <ul class="pad-p">
        <li class="text-1">
            •Signal interference from nearby wireless transmissions. Thingsgets really bad if you arenear a radio broadcasting device•OtherBluetooth signals within range. Not so bad, just a little more delay
        </li>
        <li class="text-1">
            •Obstacles in the transmission path. This makes the sounds cuts in and out all the time
        </li>
        <li class="text-1">
            •Defective internal circuits
        </li>
        <li class="text-1"> •Yes, defective internal circuits can also cause excessive amount of lag. So if you experience more than 1 or 2 seconds of lag for no obvious reason, please contact us and let us know.</li>
