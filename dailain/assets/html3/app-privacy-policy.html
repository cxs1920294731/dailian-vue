    <h4 class="title">To whom do we disclose your information?</h4>
    <h5 class="topic">
        We will not disclose your information to third parties for their own independent marketing or business purposes
        without your consent. However, we may disclose your information to the following entities:

        <li>
            <strong>Business Partners.</strong>
            We also may share your information with trusted business partners, including wireless carriers. These entities

            through SmartTV), make predictions about your interests and may provide you with promotional materials,
            advertisements and other materials.
        </li>

            We also may disclose your information to companies that provide services for or on behalf of us, such as
            companies that help us with billing or that send emails on our behalf. These entities are limited in their
            ability to use your information for purposes other than providing services for us.
        </li>
        <li>
             <strong>Other Parties When Required by Law or as Necessary to Protect Our Services. </strong>
            There may be instances when we disclose your information to other parties:
        </li>
        <li>
            to comply with the law or respond to compulsory legal process (such as a search warrant or other court order);
        </li>
        <li>
            to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Services;

            to protect the rights, property, or safety of RAVPower, or any of our respective affiliates, business partners, or customers.
        </li>
        <li>
             <strong>Other Parties in Connection With Corporate Transactions.</strong>
            We may disclose your information to a third party as part of a merger or transfer, or in the event of a bankruptcy.
        </li>
        <li>
             <strong>Other Parties With Your Consent or At Your Direction. </strong>

    <h4 class="title">What do we do to keep your information secure?</h4>
    <p class="text">
        We have put in place reasonable physical and technical measures to safeguard the information we collect in
        connection with the Services. However, please note that although we take reasonable steps to protect your information,
        no website, Internet transmission, computer system or wireless connection is completely secure.
    </p>
    <h5 class="topic">Third-Party Links and Products on Our Services</h5>
    <p class="text">Our Services may link to third-party websites and services that are outside our control. We are not
        responsible for the security or privacy of any information collected by websites or other services. You should
        exercise caution, and review the privacy statements applicable to the third-party websites and services you use.</p>
    <p class="text">We also may make available to you certain products or services (e.g., apps available through RAVPower Apps)
        developed by third parties. RAVPower is not responsible for these third-party products or services.</p>
    <h5 class="topic">Children</h5>
    <p class="text">
        We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of thirteen (13) without parental
        consent, unless permitted by law. If we learn that a child under the age of thirteen (13) has provided us with
        personal information, we will delete it in accordance with applicable law.
    </p>
    <h5 class="topic">Cookies, Beacons and Similar Technologies</h5>
    <p class="text">We, as well as certain third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on our
        Services, may use cookies, beacons, and other technologies in certain areas of our Services.</p>
    <h5 class="topic">Cookies</h5>
    <p class="text">Cookies are small files that store information on your computer, TV, mobile phone or other device.
        They enable the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognize you across different websites, services,
        devices, and/or browsing sessions. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:</p>
    <ul class="text list-type">
        <li>Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you don’t have to enter those credentials each time you log
            on to a service.</li>
        <li>Cookies help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because they
            help us to see which pages and features visitors are accessing and how much time they are spending on the pages.
            By studying this kind of information,
            we are better able to adapt the Services and provide you with a better experience. </li>
        <li>Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so that you don’t receive the same ad each time you access a Service.</li>
        <li>
            Cookies help us and third parties provide you with relevant content and advertising by collecting information
            about your use of our Services and other websites and apps.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text">
        When you use a web browser to access the Services, you can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all
        cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser
        to learn how to change your cookie preferences. The operating system of your device may contain additional
        controls for cookies.
    </p>
    <p class="text">Please note, however, that some Services may be designed to work using cookies and that disabling
        cookies may affect your ability to use those Services, or certain parts of them. Other Local Storage</p>
    <p class="text">
        We, along with certain third parties, may use other kinds of local storage technologies, such as Local Shared Objects
        (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Services. These
        technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be
        used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make
        use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using
        standard browser tools and settings.
    </p>
    <h5 class="topic">Beacons</h5>
    <p class="text">
        We, along with certain third parties, also may use technologies called beacons (or “pixels”) that communicate
        information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can
        allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content
        or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of
        your device. We and certain third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of
        our Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        By accessing and using our Services, you consent to the storage of cookies, other local storage technologies,
        beacons and other information on your devices. You also consent to the access of such cookies, local storage
        technologies, beacons and information by us and by the third parties mentioned above.
    </p>
    <h5 class="topic">
        Do Not Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms
    </h5>
    <p class="text">
        Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates, although
        web browsers incorporate and activate this functionality in different ways, and it is not always clear whether
        users intend for these signals to be transmitted. There currently is disagreement, including among participants
        in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they
        receive such signals. RAVPower currently does not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a
        standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.
